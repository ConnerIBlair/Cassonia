# Current Project: *Cassonia*
Cassonia is a long term project that my brother and I have been working on for 5+ years now. The code has been overhauled multiple times as I learn how to code more effectively, and using best practices.  
This game is set to release in 2027, with a Steam page launching this December. The goals for this project are to create a modernized take on the retro Zelda games, such as A link to the Past, that is more accessible for people to enjoy, to learn ways of efficiently creating games by developing useful creation and debugging tools, and to make a quality game that we would enjoy playing.
Highlights from the project so far:
- Player Scripts/Inventory and Player Scripts/Items (Especially the Whip, LightningStaff, Seed, and SeedPouch
- Everything in the *Dev Tools* folder
- World Functions/Bridge and World Functions/BridgeInteraction  
***If you are an employer and would like a demo of the game, send me a message through my personal email and internship account and I would be happy to provide one***
