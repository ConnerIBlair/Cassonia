    // Enemies should be able to walk on top while the player is underneath without interacting with eachother
    // But when the player shoots an arrow or swings on top of the bridge, an enemy underneath the bridge should not get hit

    // Idea
    // Change a bool in any enemy or player attack script to say on/off bridge,

    // if the tile in front of the player is that tile so that he can jump off.
